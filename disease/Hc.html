Parasitic hookworms cause these infections. The two major types of hookworms that cause infection are Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale.
The eggs of these hookworms end up on the ground after passing through human feces. They hatch into larvae, which stay in the soil until they have a chance to break through human skin.
