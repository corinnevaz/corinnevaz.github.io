Hookworm infection is an infection of the intestines that can cause an itchy rash, respiratory and gastrointestinal problems, and eventually iron deficiency anemia due to ongoing loss of blood. People can become infected when walking barefoot because hookworm larvae live in the soil and can penetrate the skin.
