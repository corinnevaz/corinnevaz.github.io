Hookworm infection prevention involves the following:<br>
<br>	Using sanitary toilet facilities<br>
<br>	Preventing the skin from directly contacting the soil (for example, by wearing shoes and using a tarp or other barrier when seated on the ground)<br>
<br>	Treating dogs and cats for hookworm to prevent them from spreading hookworms to people.<br>
<br>In areas where the infection is common, public health officials sometimes periodically treat people who are likely to be infected with hookworms and other roundworms that are spread through contaminated soil (such as whipworm) with a single dose of albendazole. This treatment helps prevent complications of these infections.
