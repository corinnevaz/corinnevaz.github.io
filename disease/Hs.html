Many people with hookworm infection do not have symptoms. However at the start of a hookworm infection, an itchy, red, raised rash (ground itch) may develop where the larvae penetrate the skin. The movement of the larvae through the lungs can cause fever, coughing, and wheezing.
<p>
When adult worms first attach in the intestine, they can cause pain in the upper abdomen, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and weight loss. Over time, severe infections cause anemia as blood is lost, and people become iron deficient. Anemia causes fatigue. In children, continuing blood loss can lead to severe anemia and may cause heart failure and widespread tissue swelling. In pregnant women with severe anemia, the fetus may not grow normally.
