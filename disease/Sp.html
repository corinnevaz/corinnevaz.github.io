To decrease the chances of getting stomach pain you should do the following: 
•	Avoid fatty foods, such as red meat, butter, fried foods and cheese.
•	Eat several small meals each day rather than two or three big meals.
•	Avoid foods that seem to make your symptoms worse.
•	Do not take over-the-counter medicines that seem to make your symptoms worse such as aspirin or ibuprofen.
•	If you are lactose intolerant, meaning you cannot fully break down foods that have milk in them, avoid milk, cheese, ice cream or other foods that contain milk. People with lactose intolerance can avoid problems caused by milk if they take supplements with lactase which helps the body break down milk. An example of this is Lactaid.
•	If your stomach ache seems to be related to constipation you might need more fiber, a stool softener, or laxatives. You can get more fiber by eating lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and taking fiber pills, powders, or wafers.
