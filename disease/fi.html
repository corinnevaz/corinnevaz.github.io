<p>Fever is when a human's body temperature goes above the normal range of 36-37 Centigrade (98-100 Fahrenheit). It is a common medical sign.Other terms for a fever include pyrexia and controlled hyperthermia. A high body temperature, or fever, is one of the ways our immune system attempts to combat an infection. Usually, the rise in body temperature helps the individual resolve an infection. However, sometimes it may rise too high, in which case, the fever can be serious and lead to complications. Doctors say that as long as the fever is mild, there is no need to bring it down - if the fever is not severe, it is probably helping to neutralize the bacterium or virus that is causing the infection. Medications to bring down a fever are called antipyretics. If the fever is causing undue discomfort, an antipyretic may be recommended.When a fever reaches or exceeds 38 Centigrade (100.4 Fahrenheit), it is no longer mild and should be checked every couple of hours.These temperatures refer to oral measurement, when the thermometer is put in the mouth. For normal armpit temperatures, the temperature measures lower than it actually is and the numbers are reduced by about 0.2-0.3 Centigrade
