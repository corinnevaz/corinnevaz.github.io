The best way to prevent lymphatic filariasis is to avoid mosquito bites. The mosquitoes that carry the microscopic worms usually bite between the hours of dusk and dawn . If you live in an area with lymphatic filariasis:<br>
	<br>At night <br>
	Sleep in an air-conditioned room or <br>
	Sleep under a mosquito net <br>
	Between dusk and dawn <br>
	Wear long sleeves and trousers and <br>
	Use mosquito repellent on exposed skin. <br>
Another approach to prevention includes giving entire communities medicine that kills the microscopic worms and controlling mosquitoes.
