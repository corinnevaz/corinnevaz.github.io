Some people with filariasis have no symptoms. Other affected individuals may have episodes of acute inflammation of lymphatic vessels (lymphangitis) along with high temperatures, shaking chills, body aches, and swollen lymph nodes. Excessive amounts of fluid may accumulate (edema) in the affected areas (i.e., arms and/or legs), but the accumulation typically resolves after the other symptoms are gone. Attacks may also be accompanied by acute inflammation of the genitalia leading, in males, to inflammation, pain and swelling of the testes (orchitis), sperm track (funiculitis), and/or sperm ducts (epididymitis). The scrotum may become abnormally swollen and painful.Bancroftian filariasis affects both the legs and the genitals. The Malayan variety affects the legs below the knees.Some people with filariasis have abnormally high levels of certain white blood cells (eosinophilia) during acute episodes of symptoms. When the inflammation resolves, these levels return to normal.Filariasis may cause chronic lymph node swelling (lymphadenopathy) even in the absence of other symptoms. Longstanding obstruction of the lymphatic vessels may lead to several other conditions. These include accumulation of fluid in the scrotum (hydrocele), the presence of lymphatic fluid in the urine (chyluria), and/or abnormally enlarged lymphatic vessels (varices). Other symptoms may include progressive edema (elephantiasis) of the female external genitalia (vulva), breasts, and/or arms and legs. Chronic edema may result in skin that is abnormally thick and has a “warty” appearance.
