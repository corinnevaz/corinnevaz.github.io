Hygiene - fever is commonly caused by bacterial or viral infections. Good hygiene practices help reduce the risk of developing an infection. This includes hand-washing before and after meals, and after going to the toilet.
<br>A person with a fever caused by an infection should have as little contact as possible with other people, to prevent the infection from spreading. Whoever is caring for the patient should regularly wash their hands with warm soap and water.
