Antarang works with youth ages 14 – 25 through our CareerAware and CareeReady programs. Our primary objectives are to encourage students to stay in formal education for as long as possible; and to assist youth from disadvantaged backgrounds to bridge the gap between education to employability and launch themselves on the path to a fulfilling career.
</p>
<p>
Antarang Foundation is growing out of its infancy and requires nurturers who will guide the organization through childhood to adolescence.
</p>
<p>
We are a 5 year old organization doubling our reach and impact every year. We work with the most vulnerable communities and send our students in pursuit of their dreams. Our students are filmmakers, podcast specialists, fitness trainers and study in colleges from Bhandup to Boston.
</p>
<p>
This is because Antarang’s programs are unique and focus on bridging the ability of adolescents and young adults to make informed career decisions, and industry’s intent to hire talent with potential. We are now at the cusp of scaling our proven models and are looking for driven, high energy and committed candidates with a proven track record who can shepherd us to scale.
