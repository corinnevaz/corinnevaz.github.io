MUKTI is a non-profit socio-economic organization working for needy people of Sunderban for last 15 years. Many of our well-wishers do visit the fields and wish to do so more. MUKTI has come up with an unique idea to give you the chance to be part of this mission along with fun. 

The tour comprise of organic vegetable farm visit, exhibitions by villagers and finally in Sunderban Bonni Camp Tiger Observatory for a day.

We started with menstrual hygiene, covering the changes that happen during puberty and basic stuff about self-esteem, the taboos around menstruation and why they exist. Then, Sarva and I developed the more comprehensive Mukti curriculum and also give education to all.
