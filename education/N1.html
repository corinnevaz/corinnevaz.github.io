 Project Nanhi Kali was initiated in 1996 by the K. C. Mahindra Education Trust (KCMET) with the aim of providing primary education to underprivileged girl children in India.

Anand Mahindra, the current chairman of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., founded Project Nanhi Kali. with a strong belief that educated women would not only contribute to the economy but also issues of population and social evils like the dowry system and child marriage would reduce as more women are educated.

Studies conducted in developing countries have shown that this is true. Today, even the World Bank has acknowledged that there is no investment more effective for achieving the millennium development goals than educating girls. "According to the World Bank, some of the benefits associated with girls' education include reduction of child and maternal mortality, improvement of child nutrition and health, lower fertility rates and improvement in economic production".

Apart from the objective of impacting the nation's development through education of the girl child, Anand Mahindra also wanted to   encourage Indians to ’give back’ in a focused manner. Hence Project Nanhi Kali was designed as a sponsorship support programme which allows individuals to participate and support the education of a girl child in India.
