Our school has recently bought an 8-acre land where we will be building our new school campus. An eco-friendly campus with mud houses. We would need volunteers to help us in the building process: mud brick making, putting up the walls and roofs, decorating the building through creative art works

Childâ€™s Dream partners with TKMI in order to raise awareness of different ethnic and religious groups with youth in Myanmar, and reduce ethnic and religious conflicts. In doing so, TKMI also creates young, independent leaders capable of understanding social sciences who apply their knowledge in creative and artistic ways.
