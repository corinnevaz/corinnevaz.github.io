<p>Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) - also known as "Doctors Without Borders' - is an international humanitarian aid organization providing emergency medical aid in more than 80 countries. It was founded by a group of French doctors during the Biafra conflict in the late 1960s. In their service they had found it difficult to remain silent and neutral in the civil war as required by Red Cross statutes. As part of their creed - sometimes described as "turbulent humanitarianism' - these volunteers vowed not only to help all victims but also to tell the world about violations of human rights in order to raise consciousness about the full circumstances of the plight of populations they are helping.

<p>We recognize that aid supplied by military forces can provide relief to people in need as can acts of assistance undertaken by individual soldiers or units moved by a sense of humanity. But this aid is different. It is not humanitarian assistance. It is given to reward, and it can be withheld to punish. It is often also linked with other activities, particularly intelligence gathering. By being subordinated to the military's broader objectives, such aid is fundamentally different from humanitarian aid in its nature and intent.
