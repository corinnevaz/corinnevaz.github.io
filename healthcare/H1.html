	Project HOPE operates around the world wherever the need is greatest, working side-by-side with health care workers and their communities, addressing the greatest public health challenges to enable people to live their best lives. We respond to disasters and health crises and stay on in communities long after disaster strikes to help find solutions to epidemics and any other neglected health needs.

Our mission, as a global health and humanitarian relief organization, is to place power in the hands of health care workers to save lives across the globe. We are committed to transforming lives and uplifting communities by empowering health care workers to expertly implement and teach innovative lifesaving solutions in times of need and into the future.
