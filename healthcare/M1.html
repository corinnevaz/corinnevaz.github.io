<p>Matruchaaya Orphanage is part of the Sisters of Charity of St. Anne, an international religious congregation who works mainly for poor and marginalized people. We are located in Nadiad, Gujarat and our primary mission is to provide serves for the poor, destitute and abandoned children and young adults. We provide them with shelter, education and rehabilitation. Some children may be adopted, while others are provided with higher education so that they may be independent and prepared for marriage. Also, we provide rehabilitation for mentally challenged children and offer special training so that they live with dignity and independence.
